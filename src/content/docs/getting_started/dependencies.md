## .NET 10.0 SDK

Cranberry requires the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0) to run. Please install that before running cranberry.

## Checking the install

Open the terminal. For Windows users, You can do so by doing *one* of these 
things:

1. Right click the Windows icon on your taskbar, and click "Terminal" (Windows 11). Older versions of Windows will show PowerShell instead, which should also work.
2. Press `Win + R` and type in "cmd"

And inside of your terminal, Type the following command:

```bash
cranberry
```

and press Enter. If everything is correct then you should see the Cranberry 
help message.
