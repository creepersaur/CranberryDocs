description: Overview for the Standard Namespace (Std).
---

In Cranberry, the "Standard Namespace" (`Std`) provides many language features useful for writing applications.
Some of these features include
- `Math` - Important Math functions
- `FS` - file system handling
- `IO` - terminal input / output
- `Http` - HTTP requests and server hosting
- `Env` - Getting environment/application arguments
- `JSON` - Parsing JSON
- `Random` - Random numbers
- `Task` - Timing/waiting and parallelism
- etc.

All these sub-namespaces belong to the standard namespace. You can access them like so:

```cranberry
using Std::IO
using Std::Math
```

Or you can import multiple of them at the same time:

```cranberry
using Std::{IO, FS, Random}
```

**You must import them through Std and then use them without Std.**

```cranberry
using Std::IO

let input = IO.read_line("enter your name: ")
print($"Your name is {input}")
```
